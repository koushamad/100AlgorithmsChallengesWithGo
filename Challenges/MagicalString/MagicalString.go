package MagicalString

//A string is considered to be magical if all of its characters are the same.
//You are given a string str of length N containing only lower-case alphabets a to z . You are allowed to do at max k operations on it. In each operation, you can replace any character of the given string with any other character. After at max k operations, what can be the maximum length of its substring which is also a magical string.
//
//Constraints
//1 <= N <= 5 * 10^5
//str[i] = 'a' to 'z'
//0 <= k <= 5 * 10^5
//
//Example
//str = "abaab"
//k = 1
//Output = 4
//Here we can replace 2nd character with 'a'. Resultant string will be "aaaab" and here maximum length of magical substring is 4 ("aaaa")

// O(N)
